# Deep-learning
A complete course in DL with all the videos, manuals and tasks, plus my solutions to them

It consists of 4 weeks, each can have either 1 or 2 topics. In each topic there is a **txt 
file** with links to the course video (plus sometimes under the video there are indications 
of the location and name of the training notebook from them) and a manual in the form of 
a **pdf file**. Also at the end of each week there is an individual task, in the **txt file** in 
the directory of the week there are instructions where to look for i
 
Please do not forget to do `pip install requirements.txt` at the very beginning to work with 
**Jupyter**. If you work in **Google Colab**, then you will have to prescribe `pip install` of some 
libraries yourself at the beginning of notebooks
