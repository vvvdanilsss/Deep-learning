# Deep Learning
A complete course on DL with all the videos, manuals and tasks, as well as my solutions for them

It consists of 4 weeks, each of which can have either 1 or 2 topics. In each topic there is a **.txt file** with links to the course video (plus sometimes under the video there are indications of the location and name of the workbook from them) and a manual in the form of **.pdf file**. Also at the end of each week there is an individual task, in the **.txt file** in
the catalog of the week there are instructions
 
Please don't forget to run `pip install requirements.txt` at the very beginning of the work with **Jupiter**. If you work in **Google Colab**, then you will have to register `pip install` of some libraries yourself at the beginning of notebooks
